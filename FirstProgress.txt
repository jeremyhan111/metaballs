We are currently trying to create a 2-d simulation of circles moving around in the world. We are able to implement velocity vectors and determine how much the objects should move by, but we are having some trouble getting them to actually move. We were able to copy over most of the code from lab 2 and get it to compile. Our goal is to make the necessary modifications to the circle class (and ignore all the other shape classes for now) in order to make it move, and then make it morph into the metaball structures later. Other roadblocks we are running into is deciding which parts of the previous lab is necessary and which is not, so this basically just involves cleaning up all the code to find what is savageable.
