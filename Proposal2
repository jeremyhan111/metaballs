We implemented the circles bouncing around in the world. We are currently trying to get the LERP to work and are debugging.
We decided to just use the line class that we created from Lab 2 and we understand the math behind LERP. However, the math 
on the website only shows it for one case, so we are trying to figure it out for all sixteen cases right now. We are also 
trying to get some lines to appear for just a couple of the cases.
