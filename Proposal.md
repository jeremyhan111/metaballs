# Final Project Proposal


 For our final project, we would like to create a two-dimensional implementation of metaballs. Metaballs is a visually interesting implementation of two-dimensional circles displayed in an organic-looking way to form a blobby pattern as they collide. Using a polynomial to combine various circle components, we will create an animation that demonstrates the concept of metaballs. If time permits, we will also implement a 3D version of metaballs.


# Course Concepts Used

 Through this project, we hope to develop our understanding of many of the concepts that were introduced to us in class. We will explore openGL in relation to CUDA by implementing metaballs using both of these platforms. We will rely on our understanding of the openGL pipeline learned in class, and we will build on our understanding of previous implementations of circles and spheres. In order to understand the metaball combination function, we will rely on the intuition developed while exploring the concept of noise in class. In the event that we implement a 3D version, we also hope to use lighting tools from class to make a more realistic looking model. In implementing metaballs, we will build upon graphical and mathematical tools introduced in class.


# Other software Tools

 A list of software tools that we will be using are Cuda and OpenGL. We want to code it using both tools because we are a bit curious about the differences between them, more specifically their respective speeds. We can time some iterations to see which one is faster.


# Goals

 We have a couple short term goals that we hope to reach. The first goal is to make sure that we are familiar with the software tools that we will be using, and that we can compile and get an animation working for a simple object. The second short term goal is to make sure that we understand the math behind metaballs, such as the threshold function, and develop a better understanding of linear interpolation. The third short term goal is that we want to be able to input an arbitrary number of circles and make sure that the animation runs smoothly. Then, we want to make sure that we can implement a grid-like object that will keep track of which square corners are inside a circle. Then, using math we can use linear interpolation to draw the lines that represent the locations of the circles.

# Assessment

 We will know that we have coded a successful implementation of metaballs when the balls collide and split in a fluid-like manner. Some reach goals that we think could be feasible is using other shapes instead of circles. Another possible reach goal is extending this project so that we use three-dimensional shapes instead of two-dimensional shapes.
