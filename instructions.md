# Instructions

After pulling the code, go into the build directory and type make -j8. Then, run ./qtCAD. We have four options to view the program. You can change the option by going into mypanelopengl.cpp and look at the initializegl() function. There's a variable that says int option, and you can the option so that it goes to one of the options listed directly before the variable. We have a complete simulation option that shows metaballs. We have an option that shows the bouncing balls as well as the lerp lines. We have an option that shows the 2D grid along with metaballs at a lower resolution. We also have an option where you can step through metaballs at a lower resolution, which we primarily used as a debugging tool.
